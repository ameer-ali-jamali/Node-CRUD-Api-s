# Getting Started with Your React Web App and Node.js Backend

This project combines a React web application with a Node.js backend, creating a foundation for building modern, scalable applications.

## Quick Start

To kickstart your project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ameer-ali-jamali/React-Node-CRUD-App.git
   cd yourproject
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view your app in the browser. The page will reload as you make changes, and any lint errors will be displayed in the console.

## Features
