# Getting Started with Your React Web App and Node.js Backend

This project combines a React web application with a Node.js backend, creating a foundation for building modern, scalable applications.

## Quick Start

To kickstart your project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourproject.git
   cd yourproject
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view your app in the browser. The page will reload as you make changes, and any lint errors will be displayed in the console.

## Testing

Run tests in interactive watch mode:

```bash
npm test
```

For more information on running tests, refer to the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests).

## Building for Production

To build your app for production, use the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

This creates an optimized production build in the `build` folder, ready for deployment.
